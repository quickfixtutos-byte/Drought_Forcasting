# 🌍 Drought Forecasting – Tunisia

**Master Project | Geospatial Data & Decision Support**

This project implements an interactive web dashboard for **drought forecasting in Tunisia**, based on the fusion of multiple environmental indicators:

- 🌡️ Land Surface Temperature (LST)  
- 🌿 NDVI  
- 💧 Soil Moisture  
- 🌧️ Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)

Using **Dempster–Shafer Theory of Evidence**, these indicators are fused into belief maps representing:
- Drought conditions  
- Normal conditions  
- Wet conditions  
- Uncertainty (ignorance)

The results are visualized through an interactive **Streamlit dashboard** with spatial maps and temporal analysis.

**Technologies:** Python, Xarray, Streamlit, Plotly, Remote Sensing  
**Objective:** Robust drought monitoring under uncertainty
